I'm currently a student in [Touro University Nevada][tun]'s 
[Occupational Therapy Program][msot] (MSOT).  I also have a Bachelor of Science
in [Human Services][hhs] from the [University of Northern Colorado][unco]'s 
[College of Natural & Health Sciences][cnhs].

I have worked with older adults as a CNA, and as a behavioral health specialist 
I worked with elementary-age children.

During my Level I Fieldwork I worked at Nevada Early Intervention Services,
Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health, and Mesa View Physical Therapy.  During my
Level II Fieldwork worked with students at the Clark County School District.
