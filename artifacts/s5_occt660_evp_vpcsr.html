              <p>During my level II Fieldwork I incorporated the Dynamic Theory into my
              intervention planning with a client. I learned about the Dynamic Theory in a
              book called “Pediatric Occupational Therapy,” research by (Kramer &amp; Hinojosa,
              2010). Intervention guidelines within the dynamic theory include positive
              reinforcement, which is used to help make desired behavior become more
              automatic. Encouragement and praise are used to develop skill. I included these
              guidelines during my intervention sessions with the student I used for my case
              study. Mastery of skills allows the child the generalize the skill. Dynamic
              Theory is a part of the visual perceptual framework too. It incorporates the
              visual-perceptual deficits of a child and includes the child’s environment when
              considering the intervention plan. Allow me to use an example activity from my
              case study: drawing a heart. The complexity of the activity increased as it went
              on. First, I had him trace a heart; then, I had him draw a heart by connecting
              broken lines; then, he I had him draw a missing half of the picture to complete
              it. He referred to a model for each phase of the activity. During the activity I
              was very encouraging, included positive reinforcement for close approximations
              of desired skill (visual perceptual skill), and graded the activity
              appropriately.</p>
              
              <p>This theory helped me to provide the right learning atmosphere, e.g., giving
              encouragement and praise when he produced close approximations. This strategy
              was beneficial with this particular child. He responded positively to the
              praise, especially when his attempts corresponded closely to the model.</p>
