            <p class='text'>I thought I did really well with synthesizing the information and putting together everything I learned that semester. I thought the hardest part was trying to going through the OTPF and deciding what information was applicable to this particular diagnosis. Going through the OTPF helps me to think about what are the client’s strengthens and weaknesses in a holistic perspective. This really tests my knowledge of what areas are affected by the disease and what areas are in tacked. Another aspect was what inter I learned a lot about different strokes when researching what type of stroke my patient would have for and then deciding the appropriate interventions was interesting. Before doing this activity I didn’t know what a transient ischemic attack (TIAs), I had fun learning. I felt like a did a really good job making sure to talk about every safety risk and figuring out the potential hazards.</p>
