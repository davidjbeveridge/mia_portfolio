              <p>I thought I did really well with synthesizing the information and putting
              together everything I learned during the first semester. I thought the hardest
              part was going through the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (OTPF) and
              deciding what information was applicable to a particular diagnosis. Going
              through the OTPF helps me to think about the client’s strengths and weaknesses
              from a holistic perspective. This really tested my knowledge of which areas of
              the body are affected by transient ischemic attacks and which areas are left
              intact.  Researching what type of stroke my hypothetical patient had and then
              deciding on the appropriate interventions was interesting.  Before doing this
              activity I didn’t know what a transient ischemic attack (TIAs) was, but I had
              fun learning. I felt like a did a really good job making sure to talk about
              every safety risk and figuring out the potential hazards.</p>
