  <h2 class='title'>OCCT 508: Professional Development Plan and reflection</h2>
  <p class='text'>I was able to accomplish everything I said I was going to accomplish except attending the AOTA conference. I would have loved to gone to the AOTA conference, but it was in my budget this year. I completed my fieldwork with good marks this far and I have been able to apply these theories to my fieldwork. I have applied the biomechanical approach to my level fieldwork now, I feel confident I can apply theories, models and frameworks to my fieldwork. Thankfully many of my journals were just that applying these theories. I have worked out about 3 days a week, but sometimes there were weeks I didnâ€™t exercise at all. Some of these goals were feasible and some were not. Everything I wrote a year ago are things I want to accomplish and some of the ideas were spot on what I thought I might learn. The only thing I might change that seems unrealistic is memorizing the practice framework. The exercise goals might also be too ambitious as well, it will be interesting to see if I will accomplish any of those goals.</p>
