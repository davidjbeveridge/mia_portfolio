              <p>I used the multisensory approach for intervention planning with several clients.
              At the beginning of my fieldwork I knew about some multisensory applications,
              but I did not have a full understanding of the multisensory approach. I had to
              research various applications of the multisensory approach. I was unable to find
              a single study that isolated the multisensory approach (Woodward &amp; Swinth,
              2002). I did, however, find a wealth of resources devoted to its numerous
              applications. I included these multisensory approaches in my interventions.
              These activity ideas guided my interventions. I also did a research study
              comparing a multisensory intervention to a gross motor intervention, as well as
              how each approach affected handwriting legibility. I still incorporated a
              preparatory activity and handwriting for 10-15 minutes in my study. Research by
              Woodward and Swinth (2002) guided my intervention planning and improved my
              ability to work on just multisensory activities to strengthen my study. I used
              this study with two of my clients to guide my intervention planning.</p>
              
              <p>I gained knowledge and self-confidence by researching in my spare time. I also
              gained confidence by actually implementing a study at the Clark County School
              District and developing my own PICO question for research. I thought this
              experience was beneficial and it has taught me the skills to continue to
              implement evidence-based practice when I am practicing as an occupational
              therapist in the future. I realized that I must be intentional to incorporate
              evidence-based practice, and I need to keep developing this as a future
              practitioner. Researching the multisensory approach was difficult because there
              isn’t much research that isolates multisensory activities.  I enjoy learning,
              and am always excited to learn about different interventions and their
              effectiveness to become be the best practitioner I can be.</p>
