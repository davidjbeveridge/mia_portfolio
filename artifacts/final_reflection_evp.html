              <p>One thing I really want to remember about evidence-based practice is the proper
              use of coding.  Coding is a common feature of research and all qualitative
              analysis and synthesis. Coding is sorting all data sets according to topics,
              themes, and issues important to the study. Coding is for interpretation and
              storage more than for organizing the final report.  It is important to
              appropriately sort data for a research study. Coding is not intended to be used
              for the final report, but rather, is a great tool for interpreting and storing
              data.  Organizing information through microresearch helps synthesis and analysis
              of information for the final research findings (Stake, 2010).</p>
              
              <p>Another important thing I learned about research were the different types of
              validity: predictive validity helps to determine how well a test predicts future
              outcomes; concurrent validity forecasts the present performance. I learned about
              the hierarchy of research: expert opinion, case-controlled studies, cohort
              studies, randomized controlled trials (RTCs), critically individual articles,
              critically appraised topics and systematic reviews. (Sackett, Straus &amp;
              Richardson, 2000)</p>
              
              <p>When I entered the occupational therapy program, I believed evidence-based
              practice was important to some degree, but I didn’t realize how important it is
              to provide evidence for the interventions you provide to clients.  When I took
              some time to think through what it would be like if I were receiving therapy, I
              realized that I would want my therapist to have evidence to support that what
              they are doing to is effective.  There are many treatments, but if my therapist
              could show me the research to back it up, I would be far more likely to try a
              treatment. My attitude changed and I began trying to back up everything I was
              doing in class or in fieldwork.  It was a habit that Touro instilled in me and I
              will continue to use this skill.  I have more confidence in my ability to
              understand research articles after completing a systematic review; I had to
              learn to understand the intervention used, outcomes, and clinical significance
              verses statistical significance. I can extract what I need from articles when
              interventions are being compared.</p>
              
              <p>I still have room to grow when it comes to transcribing interviews and coding
              the information from the interviews. I need to work on identifying and
              understanding bias in articles that don’t specifically discuss it.  I still find
              it difficult to understand the outcome measure in some articles because I am not
              yet familiar with a broad enough range of assessment tests and measurement
              scales; I am a novice and am familiarizing myself with assessment tests.</p>
              
              <p>Applying knowledge to actual practice situations is a struggle for me.  It is
              hard to perfectly apply evidence-based practice in every situation, but you can
              get an idea of the effectiveness of different interventions based on systematic
              reviews and other studies.  I think to truly apply evidence-based practice, you
              would need to do this with every treatment session; this seems unrealistic to
              me.  It also seems that there is a severe lack of occupational therapists in
              research; it was rare to see an occupational therapist giving the treatment in
              research studies I read. This was unnerving to me; how can we be do doing
              evidence-based practice if there is there a lack of evidence-based research
              being conducted by occupational therapists? We need more occupational therapists
              to determine the outcomes of occupation-based interventions.</p>
