  <h2 class='title'>OCCT 649: AT Device and Reflection</h2>
  <p class='text'>At Touro's 2013 Assistive Technology Fair, I presented an adaptive device designed to help a client with Cerebral Palsy to play wheelchair tennis. I couldn't find many articles about the effectiveness of similar adaptations. I found effective adaptations for a ping pong racquet for quadraplegics/tetrapalegics. I learned that producing an adaptation ensuring there is enough time to produce the adaptation is important when developing an adaptation for a client. I had trouble trying to come up with adaptations for every aspect of the tennis game for a client who had Cerebral Palsy. I thought that was the hardest part. The glove was the easiest to come up with, but I learned that it is possible to find a solution to persevere. The easiest part was researching and finding supporting articles for the adaptation.</p>
