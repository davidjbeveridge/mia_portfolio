  <h2 class='title'>OCCT 649: AT Device and Reflection</h2>
  <p class='text'>There werenâ€™t many articles that researched the effectiveness of the same adaptation. There were adaptations for a ping pong racquet and quadraplegics/ tetrapalegics that were effective. I learned that producing an adaptation and make sure to have enough time to produce this adaptation is important when trying to come up with an adaptation for a client. I had trouble trying to come up with adaptations for every aspect of the tennis game for a client who had Cerebral Palsy. I thought that was the hardest part. The glove was the easiest to come up with, but I learned that it is possible to find a solution to persevere. The easiest part was researching articles and finding supporting articles for the adaptation.</p>
