              <p>In my first fieldwork experience in early intervention services I observed
              parents who did not feel satisfied with the family-centered care they were
              receiving. I wanted to see which factors encourage or inhibit family-centered
              practice in the occupational therapy intervention process; this paper was a
              great opportunity to dig into it. I wish the authors of the source article had
              stated the questions they asked the parents whose children were receiving
              occupational therapy services. I think this was a weakness in their study; it
              would have been nice if they had provided more results to help the reader decide
              if they categorized the data correctly in the designated themes they chose.</p>
              
              <p>I learned that time and support were central themes that were brought to the
              researchers attention. Some families who received early intervention services
              felt they didn’t receive enough support or time during intervention services.
              When providing occupational therapy services within early intervention, I will
              remember to remember the perspective of the families that felt overwhelmed in
              trying to juggle work, household demands and care-taking. It is important to
              help educate the families about the importance of being involved in the
              intervention plan and make accommodations to the families by implementing
              interesting activities to improve parental involvement. Another option
              occupational therapists should keep in mind is providing audio or a different
              visual educational tools like videos to accommodate to their schedules or
              preferred learning style.</p>
              
              <p>I would like to see more research about why these parents wouldn’t read the
              handouts. It would be interesting to see if they would learn better with
              different teaching methods. There was clearly a communication problem; the cause
              of the parents’ non-involvement in the intervention process was inconclusive. I
              wonder if the parents would be willing to listen to audio recordings about the
              same educational material; they could listen while they performed other
              household tasks and they might be more willing to participate in the
              intervention. The study didn’t seem to produce many other questions and more
              research is needed on how to solve dissatisfaction of occupational therapy
              services. This kept me wondering about the solutions to the problem that was
              revealed in this study with some caregivers of those who have a child receiving
              early intervention services.</p>
