            <p class='text'>My first fieldwork was in early intervention services and what I observed were parents not feeling satisfied about the family-centered care they were receiving. I wanted to see what were the the factors that encourage or inhibit family-centered practice in the occupational therapy intervention process. I wished they stated the questions they asked the parents whose children were receiving occupational therapy services. This was a weakness in their study by not providing more results to help the reader decide if they categorized the data correctly in the designated themes they chose. I learned that time and support were central themes that were brought to the researchers attention. Time and support weren’t meet for some families who received early intervention services. When providing occupational therapy services within early intervention, I will remember to remember the perspective of the families that felt overwhelmed in trying to juggle work, household demands and caretaking. It would be important to help educate the families how important it is to be involved in the intervention plan and make accommodations to the families by implementing interesting activities for the parents to have them be involved. Another option to keep in mind for occupational therapist is to provide audio or a different visual educational tools like videos to accommodate to their schedules or preferred learning style. It would be interesting to have the researcher do more research about why these parents wouldn’t read the handouts. It would be interesting to see if they would learn better with different methods of learning or if that was the problem. There was clearly a miscommunication problem, and figure out why the parents weren’t responsive to being involved in the intervention process is inconclusive. If the parents would be willing to listen to audio recordings about the same educational material. They could listen while they performed other household tasks and they might be more willing to participate in the intervention. The study didn’t seemed to produced many other questions and there needs to be more research on how to solve dissatisfaction of occupational therapy services. This kept me wondering about the solutions to the problem that was revealed in this study with some caregivers of those who have a child receiving early intervention services.</p>
