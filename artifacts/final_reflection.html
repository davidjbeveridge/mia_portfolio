              <p>My understanding of social justice has broadened while attending the
              occupational therapy program at Touro University Nevada. Touro University Nevada
              has provided me with many different opportunities to go into the community
              through different class assignments.  For example, I had the opportunity to
              interview a victim of sex trafficking. This interview really changed my
              perspective and helped me to become more sensitive to others.  My experiences at
              Touro helped me to recognize the importance of equality and justice for all
              people, not just those I agree with or find easily understandable.  I am more
              intentionally proactive in my community, and look for opportunities to  help the
              marginalized or oppressed. I have learned to be more open-minded, listen to
              others, and  go out of my comfort zone to help others. I have learned that I
              don’t know everything about the marginalized or the oppressed; I have become
              more willing to listen and understand them.  The growth and understanding I have
              acquired will help me as a practitioner to be kind, understanding and willing to
              go the extra mile to make sure my clients’ concerns are heard. It’s important to
              make sure each and every client is free from occupational deprivation,
              occupational marginalization, occupational isolation, occupational imbalance.</p>
              
              <p>Through the opportunities at Touro, I have learned how to be a self-starter and
              gained the resources to pave my own path when seeking information. Information
              is powerful, and so is knowing how to find it. I have learned where to find the
              knowledge I need to be an effective therapist. For example, I know that
              evidence-based practice is important in finding effective interventions and
              providing clients with the knowledge to make informed decisions; I can find this
              information in the American Journal of Occupational Therapy (AJOT), or OT
              Practice Magazine, among other resources; I can join my state association and
              use it to connect with informational groups (e.g., a pediatrics interest group)
              that will help me learn from the clinical experience of others.  Knowledge is
              powerful: the more you know, the better you can equip clients to make informed
              decisions. I can provide the best care for my clients if I know how to evaluate
              and administer occupation-based assessments, and I keep abreast of changes to
              the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as well as new
              treatments, discoveries, and diagnoses.</p>
              
              <p>It is important to remember that, as occupational therapists, we don’t just
              provide medical services—we are serving our patients and humanity at large by
              helping each patient to live the type of life they want.  We accomplish this
              through individualized treatment, but also through public service, volunteer
              opportunities, and philanthropy.  I grew up with the idea that my life was
              intended to be used to serve others; I have chosen occupational therapy as a
              tool to that end alone.</p>
