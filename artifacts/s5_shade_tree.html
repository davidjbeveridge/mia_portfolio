              <p>I organized a donation drive for Shade Tree in conjunction with my classmate,
              Nikita Malhotra. Nikita and I sent an e-mail to the 2014 occupational therapy
              cohort asking them to bring in some items to donate; we were to collect these
              items and deliver them following week. I grew as a leader in my ability to deal
              with logistical issues, which turned out to be more nuanced than we had
              originally planned: Nikita and I had to be flexible and work with many of our
              classmates to bring items on the a different day. I intentionally led by
              example, being among the first to donate some toiletries. I communicated with
              people who had schedule conflicts and made sure to accommodate their schedule by
              extending the due date. I learned how essential communication is to being a
              leader. Communicating with Nikita and the other students in the cohort was vital
              in order to donate as many items as possible but still make a reasonable
              delivery time.</p>
