            <p class='text'>During second semester, I volunteered at the Heritage Senior Center serving food to seniors for lunch. I love serving seniors&mdash;seeing the smile on their faces brings a smile to my heart. I wanted to serve seniors and get to know them on a more personal level. I enjoy visiting seniors. Throughout my time at the Senior Center I was able to have some short conversations with seniors about where they are from, what they like to do, and whether there was anything else I could get them for their meal. I enjoyed talking to all the seniors I served. This experience taught me that small acts of service go a long way. There were several seniors that seemed upset and I quickly asked them how I could accommodate them. They wanted more bread rolls, so I asked the cook to see if it was possible to accommodate these seniors. Many seniors wanted extra salad dressing and when I came back for salad dressing they were very pleased that I took the time to get it for them. They thanked me emphatically. It brightened my day to know that serving seniors in the small things can really brighten their day.</p>
