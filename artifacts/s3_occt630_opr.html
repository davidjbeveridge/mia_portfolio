            <p class='text'>It was difficult to gather information and synthesize information in a non-traditional setting. I really struggled with trying to formulate incorporate all the problems this client presented and figure out which problem was most important. I only had one class that talked about psycosocial interventions and I felt like just one class didn’t equip me to problem solve well very well in this particular setting. I had to do a lot of self-learning. When I was interviewing the client to obtain an occupational profile it was difficult to out priorities and desired outcomes because she wanted so many unrealistic goals. There were a lot of time the client didn’t stay on topic and I had to ask the question again in a different way to get a better answer. The answers to the questions were more qualitative information and it was hard for me to think objectively about the information when writing the occupational profile and analysis. I thought the analysis was easier to obtain and synthesis the occupational profile and before completing both aspects it was going to be the other way around.</p>
