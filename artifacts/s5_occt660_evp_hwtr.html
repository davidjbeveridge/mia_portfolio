              <p>During my Level II fieldwork at Clark County School District (CCSD) I used both
              the cognitive and multisensory approach with a student who had Autism. I used
              Handwriting Without Tears (HWT) with the student and used other multisensory
              activities such as a whiteboard with chalk, rice, Play Doh, and used lotion to
              write letters on the table.</p>
              
              <p>The mulitsensory approach has been found to be effective when used cojointly
              with the cognitive approach (Donica, 2013). The HWT teaching materials are a
              great example in which both approaches are used concurrently with improvements
              in handwriting outcomes (Donica, 2013). The outcomes of this study concluded
              that those who received instruction in HWT scored significantly higher scores on
              the Test of Handwriting Skill-Revised (THS-R) for one full year of handwriting
              instruction. Curriculum was implemented for 15 minutes within the classroom.
              Some of the multisensory activities they used included rolling Play Doh, using a
              chalk slate, and arranging wooden pieces to form capital letters. I thought that
              this child needed multiple sensory inputs to help execute motor movement. I used
              the cognitive approach by using handwriting without tears workbook; I thought he
              really benefitted from the multisensory input. His facial expressions indicated
              that this was a positive experienceâ€”he gave me several big smiles! Handwriting
              became a preferred activity for this boy.</p>
