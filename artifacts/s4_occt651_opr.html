              <p>I really enjoyed this assignment. I thought this project was difficult, but it
              was rewarding because, in the end, I felt like I built rapport well with my
              client. The hardest part about this assignment was developing interviewing
              skills. Often times if you are only there for a short period of time, it is
              hard to build rapport with clients on the first session. You have to be
              sensitive with how you ask question and this was the hardest part for me.  You
              want to make sure to ask the question in the right way.  I really enjoyed
              listening to this clientâ€™s occupational history. Most of all, I left feeling
              really good about getting to know this client and I know I made him feel
              comfortable because we had a lot of things in common when talking about his
              interests, hopes, and dreams.</p>
