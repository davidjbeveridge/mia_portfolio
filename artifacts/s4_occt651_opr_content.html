  <h2 class='title'>Semester 4&mdash;OCCT 651: Occupational profile and reflection</h2>
  <p class='text'>I really enjoyed this assignment. I thought this project was difficult, but it was rewarding because, in the end, I felt like I built rapport well with my client. The hardest part about this assignment was developing interviewing skills. Often times if you are only there for a short period of time, it is hard to build rapport with clients on the first session. You have to be sensitive with how you ask question and this was the hardest part for me.  You want to make sure to ask the question in the right way.  I really enjoyed listening to this clientâ€™s occupational history. Most of all, I left feeling really good about getting to know this client and I know I made him feel comfortable because we had a lot of things in common when talking about his interests and hopes and dreams.</p>
