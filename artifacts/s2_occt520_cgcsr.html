              <p>I enjoyed learning about autism. Finding research to support our
              interventions with Emily was my favorite part. I learned how children with
              Autism can benefit from programs that promote turn-taking, eye-contact, and
              verbal and non-verbal communication. We choose “Connect Four” to help Emily
              gain social skills and an activity she would enjoy. Connect Four was also
              educational for Emily and helped strengthen her cognitive skills. Learning
              more about Handwriting Without Tears was very fun and effective in helping
              children improve legibility including ability to write their first name.
              Daily picture schedules help develop the ability to transition from one
              activity to another and it also improves behavior. I really enjoyed
              picking activities that were appropriate for Emily. The hardest part of the
              entire case study was coming up with appropriate objectives for the goals we
              specified. I would like to do my first level II Fieldwork in a school, so I
              enjoyed these interventions for our client, Emily. It was hard to pick an
              activity that was individualized for Emily; we had so many ideas at first,
              it was hard to narrow it down.</p>
