            <p class='text'>I enjoyed learning about Autism. In researching articles backing up evidence to support our interventions with Emily was my favorite part. Learning how children with Autism can benefit from programs that promote turn-taking, eye-contact, as well as verbal and non-verbal communication. We choose connect four to help Emily gain social skills and an activity she would enjoy. Connect four was also educational for Emily and helped strengthen her cognitive skills. Learning more about Handwriting Without tears was very fun and effective in helping children improve legibility including ability to write their first name. Daily picture schedules help develop ability to transition from different activities to another and it also improves behavior. My favorite part was picking activities that were appropriate for Emily. The hardest part of the entire case study was coming up with appropriate objectives for the particular goals we specified. I plan on doing my first level 1 fieldwork in a school, so I enjoyed these interventions for our client, Emily. It was hard picking a particular activity that was individualize for Emily, we had many ideas at first, but we then narrow it down and what was most important or pertinent.</p>
