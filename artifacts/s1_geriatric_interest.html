            <p class='text'>I chose being a member of the Geriatric Group on campus for my leadership artifact. This is a leadership-based artifact because I will be going out into the community to volunteer my time. We are volunteering to make sure older adults have a better quality of life through various activities. I am taking the initiative to go out and help, listen, advocate by listening to what they need changed! This is important to me because I eventually want to work with older adults and want them to be heard. Many people over-look the older population and think how they are, stuck in their ways, bitter at the world, and have nothing good to say. They contribute to our lives and impact us in many different ways, they are a wellspring of great advice, and they are encouraging.</p>
