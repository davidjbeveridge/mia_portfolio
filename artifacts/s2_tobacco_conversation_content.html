  <h2 class='title'>How to Have a Conversation About Tobacco Use and having a conversation about</h2>
  <p class='text'>In January 2013 I attended a seminar on, How to Have a Conversation about Tobacco Use. I really enjoyed this seminar and I found the several of the methods to be very useful. My grandmother died of lung cancer because she smoked a pack a day for most of her life. Tobacco is very dangerous and harmful to the body. I know how important it is to have those difficult conversations about quitting with someone else you know. They talked about several different approaches when talking to someone uses tobacco. The Prochaska’s Stages of Change and Motivational Interviewing are several of the approaches and interventions you can try when talking to someone about quitting smoking. A week later I talked to one of my friends who smokes and had told me her husband her were going to try to stop smoking. I did in fact utilize the 5A’s ( Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange follow-up). They both tried holding eachother accountable after I had that conversation and have successfully quit smoking. I did what they recommended at the seminar. I made it simple, I asked because I did care about my friend and I didn’t judge. They reward themselves every 2 weeks and have officially quit smoking. This seminar really taught me the skills to help me in my professional life to be able to talk to older adults about difficult conversations.</p>
