  <h2 class='title'>OCCT 523: Qualitative Paper and reflection</h2>
  <p class='text'>
    Using a social media website allowed us students to sample attitudes of the public in a convenient format. In this way we offered privacy and flexibility to respondents. This study was a sixteen question media survey presented on Facebook. I thought using facebook to help collect data from the public was an excellent idea. If I had to answer questions like these I would not answer honestly if they weren’t confidential. Many of the respondent’s, thankfully were honest and the results were interesting. Furthermore, the link was viewable by Facebook members and was available for one week using Google spreadsheets allowing the ability to complete the questionnaire at their own pace.
    When we compared the interview results of the first year OT students to data collected from the Facebook community, the results are alarmingly similar. Very few people knew exactly what an occupational therapist did, the majority had one accurate description, and some had no idea. These results made me re-think about how I can be more vocal about what an occupational therapy role within healthcare really is and sharing this with anyone who will listen. I think it is important as students to continue to encourage researchers and occupational therapist to educate others about the services our profession can provide. The area I grew most in was when I learned to actually code through writing this paper. I never knew the amount of energy it takes to code all this information and wondered if there is an easier way to categorize information quicker. Luckily our study didn’t represent more than 100 individuals.
