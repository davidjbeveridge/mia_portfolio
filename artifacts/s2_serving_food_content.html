  <h2 class='title'>Serving Food at the Henderson Multigenerational Center</h2>
  <p class='text'>My social justice artifact is volunteering at the Heritage Senior Center and serving food to seniors for lunch. This is important to me because I like to serve seniors. I wanted to serve seniors and get to know them on a more personal level. I enjoy visiting seniors. Throughout my time at the Senior Center I was able to have some short conversations with seniors about where they are from, what they like to do and if there was anything else I could get them for their meal. I enjoyed talking to all the seniors I served. This experience taught me small acts of service go a long way. There were several seniors that seemed upset and I quickly asked them how I could accommodate them. They wanted more bread rolls, so I asked the cook to see if it was possible to accommodate this senior. Many seniors want extra salad dressing and when I came back for salad dressing they were so pleased that I would take the time to get it for them. Immediately they thank me emphatically. It brightened my day to know just serving seniors in the small things can really brighten their day.</p>
