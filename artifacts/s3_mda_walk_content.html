  <h2 class='title'>Semester 3&mdash;MDA Walk</h2>
  <p class='text'>On March 16th I attended the Muscular Dystrophy Walk I was interested in walking for the MD walk mainly to send kids to camp. We were able to raise enough money to send two kids to camp! Much of the fundraising money goes to research projects, summer camps, MDA equipment lending program that helps families in need. Participating in this event made me feel that I was part of a bigger piece of the puzzle in helping kids with muscular dystrophy have good time at camp.</p>
