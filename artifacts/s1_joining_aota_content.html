  <h2 class='title'>Joining AOTA</h2>
  <p class='text'>
    
    Being a member of AOTA is a great way keep abreast of new information within occupational therapy. It also allows me to be a part of a network where innovative research takes place, new ideas are formed within the profession, and these ideas are shared between occupational therapists. I think it's important to join AOTA because it allows me to stay connected to the changes in the profession. It allows me to read occupational information, helps me to stay interested in new ideas, and stay connected if I need guidance in the field. AOTA is a pool of knowledge.
