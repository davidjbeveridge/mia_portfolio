              <p>I was able to accomplish everything I said I was going to accomplish during my
              first year at Touro, except for attending the AOTA conference. I would have
              loved to go to the AOTA conference, but I wasn’t able to afford it. I completed
              my fieldwork with good marks thus far and I have been able to apply these
              theories to my fieldwork. I have applied the biomechanical approach to my Level
              I Fieldwork and now I feel confident I can apply theories, models, and
              frameworks to my fieldwork.</p>
              
              <p>Thankfully, many of my journals were just that—applying these theories. I
              have worked out about three days a week, but there were some weeks I didn’t
              exercise at all. Some of these goals were feasible and some were not. Everything
              I wrote a year ago are things I want to accomplish and some of the ideas were
              exactly what I thought I might learn. The only thing I might change that seems
              unrealistic is memorizing the practice framework.  The exercise goals might also
              be too ambitious as well; it will be interesting to see which of my goals I can
              accomplish.</p>
