  <h2 class='title'>Spread the Word to End the Word</h2>
  <p class='text'>My social justice artifact is pledging to not use the r-word. I pledged to end the use of the r-word. Spread the Word to End the Word, “retarded”. The Special Olympics helps with the ongoing intent to promote the inclusion and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities. By promoting not using the r-word we are advocating for individuals who have intellectual disabilities to make sure they are being treated appropriately. Using the r-word excludes people from social groups and does not emphasize their strengths. It alienates certain people and I am helping to put a stop to this. This is important to me because I think individuals who have disabilities need to be encouraged by not using the r-word. It is important to me to not reinforce the stereotypes of people who have intellectual disabilities. It shouldn’t be acceptable and is not acceptable to degrade or insult those who have intellectual disabilities.</p>
