  <h2 class='title'>Semester 3&mdash;Vice President of the Geriatric Interest Group</h2>
  <p class='text'>In April of 2013, I was elected Vice President of the Geriatric Interest Group. I attended several officer meetings to discuss what events we were going to attend this following year. We decided we were going to be a part of the voter registration campaign, Parkinsonâ€™s walk, salad fundraiser, American Geriatric Society Conference and volunteer at the Heritage Senior Center. It was interesting to try to plan out the year together with the other new officers.  I really enjoyed getting to know the other officers and strategically plan with them. We are all different, but it's great to share the same vision to serve seniors in the community as future health professionals.</p>
