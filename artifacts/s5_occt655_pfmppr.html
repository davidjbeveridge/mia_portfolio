              <p>The marginalized group we presented on were victims of sex trafficking. I really
              enjoyed the interview portion of this assignment; the person we interviewed
              wishes to remain anonymous, so I will not mention her name here. I enjoyed the
              interview because it seemed more real than the book we read; it’s completely
              different when someone tells you their story in person. Our interviewee was very
              willing to tell us about her experiences and about other women she knows who
              have been sex trafficked. I thought the presentation was very difficult to
              discuss; educating our classmates was difficult with such a vulnerable topic.
              The hardest part about educating others was discussing the terrible offenses
              that others have experienced because they were sex trafficked. One of the
              scariest points we made was this could happen to anyone. Sadly, it happens to
              girls who are very young. I learned that we, as occupational therapist, can
              provide an environment for healing and help victims of sex trafficking to
              perform basic activities of daily living (ADL’s) like taking a showers again;
              this can be a struggle after suffering from abuse. Many times an abuser will
              force victims to perform ADL’s at specific times, against their will; when they
              come out of captivity, many times they are psychologically unable to perform the
              daily activities that we take for granted. As occupational therapists, we can
              help them overcome this sad product of their abuse.</p>
