              <p>There are many things that can divide us from one another, such as socioeconomic
              status, ethnicity, cultural barriers, language barriers, or access to
              healthcare.  There are many reasons for which an individual might be
              discriminated against such as age or sexual orientation.  Certain circumstances
              can hinder access to participation in meaningful occupations.  For example,
              victims of sex trafficking are often forced by their captors to participate in
              non-preferred occupations, and are often prohibited from participating in
              activities of daily living.</p>
              
              <p>It is also important to consider the role played by occupational
              marginalization. Occupational marginalization is when people with disabilities
              are excluded from being able to participate something they enjoy (e.g., sports).
              This differs from occupational deprivation, which is when something outside of
              your control prevents you from doing an important or meaningful occupation;
              e.g., aboriginal women and men living in the amazon are deprived of the
              opportunity to ski by virtue of their isolated locale (Townsend &amp; Wilcock,
              2004).</p>
              
              <p>I also think we need to be cognizant of ageism.  When we are younger we tend to
              think we won’t be treated the way the older generation is treated today usually
              in nursing care facilities, (e.g. take showers once a week, or not be asked
              about treatment options such as living in an individual room without anyone
              else) (Hayes, 2013). We can’t ignore the important issue of ageism—we need
              changes to our healthcare system.</p>
              
              <p>We also need to be careful not to allow discrimination against the LGBT
              community.  We should unite people of different sexual orientations to advocate
              for the LGBT community, rather than leaving the LGBT community to fight their
              battle against oppression alone.</p>
              
              <p>My understanding of social justice has been expanded during my time at Touro. I
              grew as a student by being exposed to facts, figures and the perspectives of
              people from many different marginalized populations.  This helped me to develop
              a better understanding of oppression. While at Touro, I constantly found myself
              thinking about helping different people groups to provide them with social
              justice.  I realize I can’t actually help everyone, but I think I have learned
              to narrow my goals to be more realistic.  I can focus on oppressed groups that I
              relate to, or am a part of, and be their voice; I can help those who are
              marginalized feel empowered by providing occupational justice.</p>
              
              <p>My experience at Touro has helped me to become less judgmental towards
              particular people groups such as the LGBT group, and victims of sex trafficking.
              I have gained a sense of compassion for all groups who are occupationally
              deprived.</p>
              
              <p>I feel I have the ability to accurately identify if an individual might be
              experiencing occupational deprivation, occupational isolation, occupational
              alienation, occupational marginalization, or occupational imbalance. I can use
              my knowledge and personal understanding to be sensitive to clients who are
              experiencing any of these, as well as to to advocate for them. </p>
              
              <p>Serving food to older adults at the multigenerational center allowed me to treat
              older adults with respect and treat them the way I want to be treated when I am
              older. I listened intently and made sure to meet their need immediately.</p>
              
              <p>I helped in the fight against occupational isolation by participating in the
              Musclar Dystrophy Association (MDA) walk.   The MDA provides opportunities and
              resources for children with muscular dystrophy so they can experience meaningful
              occupations.</p>
              
              <p>I fought against occupational marginalization by advocating for a student with
              vision impairment.  Due to her impairment, the basic expectations of her
              education were being ignored. She was deprived from receiving the best education
              due to outside circumstances that could be resolved.</p>
              
              <p>I participated in fighting occupational deprivation by making meals at three
              square, which provides meals for families in need.</p>
