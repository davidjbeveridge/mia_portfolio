              <p>During 4th Semester, I ran a donation drive at my church for the Las Vegas
              Rescue Mission. Getting others to donate items to the Rescue Mission was more
              difficult than I anticipated. I sent out an email requesting donations for the
              Rescue Mission. I got a number of replies, but nearly everyone told me that they
              had recently cleaned their house and had given items away already. I tried to
              promote the cause and reminded them of the importance of donating. I knew many
              of these people well, and suspected that they had items they no longer wanted.
              It was frustrating to hear that they didn’t have anything to donate; I felt like
              I wasn’t being taken seriously, and it was hard to be patient. I asked them
              every week if they had found anything to donate. Finally, several people said
              they had some gently-used clothes and bedding that they could donate. I grew as
              an advocate by learning to be persistent and not give up. I learned that
              advocating for those in need can be as simple as persistently and kindly asking
              friends if they have anything they would like to donate.</p>
