I really enjoyed this assignment. I thought this project was difficult, but it
was rewarding because, in the end, I felt like I built rapport well with my
client. The hardest part about this assignment was developing interviewing
skills. Often times if you are only there for a short period of time, it is
hard to build rapport with clients on the first session. You have to be
sensitive with how you ask question and this was the hardest part for me.  You
want to make sure to ask the question in the right way.  I really enjoyed
listening to this clientâ€™s occupational history. Most of all, I left feeling
really good about getting to know this client and I know I made him feel
comfortable because we had a lot of things in common when talking about his
interests and hopes and dreams.
