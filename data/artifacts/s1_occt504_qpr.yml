title: "OCCT 504: Quantitative Paper and reflection"
summary: A paper about Stroke and CIMT.
text: >
  In my first semester I was very interested in learning about stroke.
  It is interesting to me that I picked constrained induced movement
  therapy on upper extremity. I was so fascinated in researching how
  CIMT works and if it really worked, I was kind of skeptical before
  reading this article. The control group improved most on the
  Performance Time and the Functional Ability scale. When they compared
  the two groups (the treatment group and non-treatment group), the
  researchers saw a dramatic improvement with individuals who were apart
  of the CIMT group with quality and speed of their paretic arm movement
  after the treatment in the CIMT group. It was also interesting to see
  a longitudinal study gathered data by following up with the
  participants 4, 8, and 12 months.
  
  I had a difficult time with APA
  formatting for my reference page and making sure I was clear in
  providing headings for each section. I struggled with a more depth
  statistical analysis. Overall, I had a great time learning about this
  randomized clinical trial and this study became useful in me knowing
  more about this intervention while attending various classes. I gained
  more understanding on how therapists typically implement a CIMT
  intervention and I was glad I chose this topic.
