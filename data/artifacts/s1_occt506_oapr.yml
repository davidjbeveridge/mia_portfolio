  I thought I did really well with synthesizing the information and putting
  together everything I learned that semester. I thought the hardest part
  was trying to going through the OTPF and deciding what information was
  applicable to this particular diagnosis. Going through the OTPF helps me
  to think about what are the client’s strengthens and weaknesses in a
  holistic perspective. This really tests my knowledge of what areas are
  affected by the disease and what areas are in tacked. Another aspect was
  what inter I learned a lot about different strokes when researching what
  type of stroke my patient would have for and then deciding the appropriate
  interventions was interesting. Before doing this activity I didn’t know
  what a transient ischemic attack (TIAs), I had fun learning. I felt like a
  did a really good job making sure to talk about every safety risk and
  figuring out the potential hazards.
