It was difficult to gather information and synthesize information in a
non-traditional setting. I really struggled with trying to incorporate all
the problems this client presented and figure out which was most important.
I only had one class that talked about psycosocial interventions and I felt
like a single class didn’t equip me to problem-solve well very well in this
particular setting. I had to do a lot of self-learning. When I was
interviewing the client to obtain an occupational profile it was difficult
to set priorities and desired outcomes because she had a plethora of goals,
not all of which were realistic. Much of the time the client didn’t stay on
topic and I had to rephrase the question in order to obtain a better answer.
The answers to the questions were primarily qualitative information and it
was hard for me to think objectively about the information when writing the
occupational profile and analysis.
