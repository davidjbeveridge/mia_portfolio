At Touro's 2013 Assistive Technology Fair, I presented an adaptive device
designed to help a client with Cerebral Palsy to play wheelchair tennis. I
couldn't find many articles about the effectiveness of similar adaptations.
I found effective adaptations for a ping pong racquet for
quadraplegics/tetrapalegics. I learned that producing an adaptation ensuring
there is enough time to produce the adaptation is important when developing
an adaptation for a client. I had trouble trying to come up with adaptations
for every aspect of the tennis game for a client who had Cerebral Palsy. I
thought that was the hardest part. The glove was the easiest to come up
with, but I learned that it is possible to find a solution to persevere. The
easiest part was researching and finding supporting articles for the
adaptation.
