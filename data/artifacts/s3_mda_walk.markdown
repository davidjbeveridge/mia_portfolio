On March 16th I attended the Muscular Dystrophy Walk.  I was interested in
walking for the MDA walk mainly to send kids to camp. We were able to raise
enough money to send two kids to camp! Much of the fundraising money goes to
research projects, summer camps, and the MDA equipment lending program that
helps families in need. Participating in this event made me feel that I was part
of a bigger piece of the puzzle in helping kids with muscular dystrophy have
a good time at camp.
