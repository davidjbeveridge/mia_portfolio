During my Level II Fieldwork at Clark County School District (CCSD) I used both
the cognitive and multisensory approach with a student who had Autism. I used
Handwriting Without Tears (HWT) with the student and used other multisensory
activities such as a whiteboard with chalk, rice, Play Doh, and used lotion to
write letters on the table.

The mulitsensory approach has been found to be effective when used cojointly
with the cognitive approach (Donica, 2013). The HWT teaching materials are a
great example in which both approaches are used concurrently with improvements
in handwriting outcomes (Donica, 2013). The outcomes of this study concluded
that those who received instruction in HWT scored significantly higher scores on
the Test of Handwriting Skill-Revised (THS-R) for one full year of handwriting
instruction. Curriculum was implemented for 15 minutes within the classroom.
Some of the multisensory activities they used included rolling Play Doh, using a
chalk slate, and arranging wooden pieces to form capital letters. I thought that
this child needed multiple sensory inputs to help execute motor movement. I used
the cognitive approach by using handwriting without tears workbook; I thought he
really benefitted from the multisensory input. His facial expressions indicated
that this was a positive experienceâ€”he gave me several big smiles! Handwriting
became a preferred activity for this boy.
