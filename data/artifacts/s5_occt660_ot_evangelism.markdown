During my first Level II Fieldwork at Clark County School District, I had the
opportunity to explain the values and beliefs of occupational therapy to one of
the teachers I worked with. I felt comfortable talking to a teacher about the
values and beliefs. It went well and I learned that teachers have similar values
and beliefs. I took the initiative to talk to the teacher; she was not expecting
me to ask if she would have time to discuss occupational therapy values and
beliefs. She worked with several of the students who were on my caseload and she
was familiar with the scope of occupational therapy. After this encounter, I
felt confident about approaching anyone to discuss occupational therapy values
and beliefs. I want others to be more educated about our values and beliefs and
how it affects treatment sessions. I led by educating others about our scope of
practice, our values, our beliefs, and how that affects evaluations, treatment
plans and outcomes in a positive way. I represented occurring therapy as a
sophisticated discipline.
