I enjoyed preparing food for the homeless. It was a great experience, the
hardest part about preparing food was chopping up the onions into tiny pieces.
My eyes were watering the entire time, but I know it is important to be
diligent in serving others, so I took small breaks by alternating between
cutting onions and slicing grapes in half to take the seeds out. I also
assembled care packages with candies and other goodies in a bag. I enjoyed
working as a team with the other volunteers. I felt really great about helping
to prepare a free meal to the homeless downtown Las Vegas.
