I was able to accomplish everything I said I was going to accomplish except
attending the AOTA conference. I would have loved to gone to the AOTA
conference, but I wasn't able to afford it. I completed my fieldwork with
good marks thus far and I have been able to apply these theories to my
fieldwork. I have applied the biomechanical approach to my level 1 fieldwork
and now I feel confident I can apply theories, models, and frameworks to my
fieldwork.

Thankfully, many of my journals were just that&mdash;applying
these theories. I have worked out about 3 days a week, but there were some
weeks I didnâ€™t exercise at all. Some of these goals were feasible and some
were not. Everything I wrote a year ago are things I want to accomplish and
some of the ideas were exactly what I thought I might learn. The only thing
I might change that seems unrealistic is memorizing the practice framework.
The exercise goals might also be too ambitious as well; it will be
interesting to see which of my goals I can accomplish.
