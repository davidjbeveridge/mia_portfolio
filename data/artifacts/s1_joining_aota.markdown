Being a member of AOTA is a great way keep abreast of new information within
occupational therapy. It also allows me to be a part of a network where
innovative research takes place, new ideas are formed within the profession,
and these ideas are shared between occupational therapists. I think it's
important to join AOTA because it allows me to stay connected to the changes
in the profession. It allows me to read occupational information, helps me
to stay interested in new ideas, and stay connected if I need guidance in
the field. AOTA is a pool of knowledge.
