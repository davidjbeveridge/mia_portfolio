title: "Semester 5&mdash;OCCT 655: Powerpoint from Marginalized Population Presentation and Reflection"
summary: >
  A reflection on a presentation my group gave about the victims of sex
  trafficking.
---

The marginalized group we presented on were victims of sex trafficking. I really
enjoyed the interview portion of this assignment; the person we interviewed
wishes to remain anonymous, so I will not mention her name here. I enjoyed the
interview because it seemed more real than the book we read; it's completely
different when someone tells you their story in person. Our interviewee was very
willing to tell us about her experiences and about other women she knows who
have been sex trafficked. I thought the presentation was very difficult to
discuss; educating our classmates was difficult with such a vulnerable topic.
The hardest part about educating others was discussing the terrible offenses
that others have experienced because they were sex trafficked. One of the
scariest points we made was this could happen to anyone. Sadly, it happens to
girls who are very young. I learned that we, as occupational therapist, can
provide an environment for healing and help victims of sex trafficking to
perform basic activities of daily living (ADL's) like taking a showers again;
this can be a struggle after suffering from abuse. Many times an abuser will
force victims to perform ADL's at specific times, against their will; when they
come out of captivity, many times they are psychologically unable to perform the
daily activities that we take for granted. As occupational therapists, we can
help them overcome this sad product of their abuse.
