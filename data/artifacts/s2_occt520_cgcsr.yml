  I enjoyed learning about Autism. In researching articles backing up
  evidence to support our interventions with Emily was my favorite part.
  Learning how children with Autism can benefit from programs that promote
  turn-taking, eye-contact, as well as verbal and non-verbal communication.
  We choose connect four to help Emily gain social skills and an activity
  she would enjoy. Connect four was also educational for Emily and helped
  strengthen her cognitive skills. Learning more about Handwriting Without
  tears was very fun and effective in helping children improve legibility
  including ability to write their first name. Daily picture schedules help
  develop ability to transition from different activities to another and it
  also improves behavior. My favorite part was picking activities that were
  appropriate for Emily. The hardest part of the entire case study was
  coming up with appropriate objectives for the particular goals we
  specified. I plan on doing my first level 1 fieldwork in a school, so I
  enjoyed these interventions for our client, Emily. It was hard picking a
  particular activity that was individualize for Emily, we had many ideas at
  first, but we then narrow it down and what was most important or
  pertinent.
