  On March 16th I attended the Muscular Dystrophy walkv I was interested in
  walking for the MD walk mainly to send kids to camp. We were able to raise
  enough money to send two kids to camp! Much of the fundraising money goes to
  research projects, summer camps, MDA equipment lending program that helps
  families in need. Participating in this event made me feel that I was part
  of a bigger piece of the puzzle in helping kids with muscular dystrophy
  have good time at camp.
