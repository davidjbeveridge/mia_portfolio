  On March 16th I attended the Muscular Dystrophy walk, I was interested in
  walking for the MD walk mainly to send kids to camp. We were able to raise
  enough money to send two kids to camp. Much of the fundraising money goes to
  research projects, summer camps, MDA equipment program that helps families
  lend durable medical equipment for those in need of equipment, participating
  in this event brought me hope that I was part of a bigger piece of the
  puzzle in helping those who muscular dystrophy have good time at camp, this
  money went to great causes.
