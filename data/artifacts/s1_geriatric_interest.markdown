Being a member of the Geriatric Group on campus is a leadership activity
because I will be going out into the community to volunteer my time. We are
volunteering to make sure older adults have a better quality of life through
various activities. I am taking the initiative to go out and help, listen,
and advocate for older adults. This is important to me because I eventually
want to work with older adults and I want them to be heard. Many people
overlook the older population and stereotype them as stuck in their ways,
bitter at the world, and negative. They contribute to our
lives and impact us in many different ways: they are a wellspring of great
advice, and they are sometimes very encouraging.
