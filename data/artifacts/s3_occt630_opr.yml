  It was difficult to gather information and synthesize information in a
  non-traditional setting. I really struggled with trying to formulate
  incorporate all the problems this client presented and figure out which
  problem was most important. I only had one class that talked about
  psycosocial interventions and I felt like just one class didn’t equip me
  to problem solve well very well in this particular setting. I had to do a
  lot of self-learning. When I was interviewing the client to obtain an
  occupational profile it was difficult to out priorities and desired
  outcomes because she wanted so many unrealistic goals. There were a lot of
  time the client didn’t stay on topic and I had to ask the question again
  in a different way to get a better answer. The answers to the questions
  were more qualitative information and it was hard for me to think
  objectively about the information when writing the occupational profile
  and analysis. I thought the analysis was easier to obtain and synthesis
  the occupational profile and before completing both aspects it was going
  to be the other way around.
