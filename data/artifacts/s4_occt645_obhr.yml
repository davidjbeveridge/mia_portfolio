  This home assessment was longer than the other short home assessments we had
  done in class, as it was more in depth. I did not enjoy how long the
  assessment was; however, I did enjoy measuring the height and width of
  doorways; it was a great way to figure out if adaptations were needed. For
  example, if a client had a wheelchair and needed to know if the wheelchair fit
  through certain doorways, it could be helpful to know different doorway
  dimensions. Another important aspect of this home evaluation was the part
  where we described what occupations take place in a particular area of the
  home.

  This gave me important insight: for example, if a client was in a wheelchair
  and was unable to reach the top cupboard shelf or the hanging rod in the
  closet, the therapist could suggest low-cost home modifications like storing
  kitchen items on the counter instead of the top shelf, or moving the hanging
  rod in the closet to a lower position within the client's reach.  I enjoyed
  this assignment because it taught me how relevant the assessment is to
  occupation-based practice. I was surprised how often occupation is
  addressedâ€”the beginning of each section discusses which occupations
  typically take place in that area; at the end of the each sub-component
  there are questions about ways to improve occupations, mobility and ease of
  use. I was surprised this assessment asks about the ease of use.  This helps
  the clinician to fill this assessment out and helps them to think in terms
  of how to modify each environment within the house or apartment, if
  necessary, in order to improve performance of desired occupations. I like
  how there is both objective and subjective information to fill out; this
  makes for a fuller understanding of the environmental barriers within an
  apartment or a house.
