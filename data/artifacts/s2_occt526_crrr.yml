title: "OCCT 526: Child-based Research Review and reflection"
summary: "Parental involvement in early intervention services"
text: >
  My first fieldwork was in early intervention services and what I observed
  were parents not feeling satisfied about the family-centered care they were
  receiving. I wanted to see what were the the factors that encourage or
  inhibit family-centered practice in the occupational therapy intervention
  process. I wished they stated the questions they asked the parents whose
  children were receiving occupational therapy services. This was a weakness
  in their study by not providing more results to help the reader decide if
  they categorized the data correctly in the designated themes they chose. I
  learned that time and support were central themes that were brought to the
  researchers attention. Time and support weren’t meet for some families who
  received early intervention services. When providing occupational therapy
  services within early intervention, I will remember to remember the
  perspective of the families that felt overwhelmed in trying to juggle work,
  household demands and caretaking. It would be important to help educate the
  families how important it is to be involved in the intervention plan and
  make accommodations to the families by implementing interesting activities
  for the parents to have them be involved. Another option to keep in mind for
  occupational therapist is to provide audio or a different visual educational
  tools like videos to accommodate to their schedules or preferred learning
  style. It would be interesting to have the researcher do more research about
  why these parents wouldn’t read the handouts. It would be interesting to see
  if they would learn better with different methods of learning or if that was
  the problem. There was clearly a miscommunication problem, and figure out
  why the parents weren’t responsive to being involved in the intervention
  process is inconclusive. If the parents would be willing to listen to audio
  recordings about the same educational material. They could listen while they
  performed other household tasks and they might be more willing to
  participate in the intervention. The study didn’t seemed to produced many
  other questions and there needs to be more research on how to solve
  dissatisfaction of occupational therapy services. This kept me wondering
  about the solutions to the problem that was revealed in this study with some
  caregivers of those who have a child receiving early intervention services.
