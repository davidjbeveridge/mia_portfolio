I enjoyed learning about autism. Finding research to support our
interventions with Emily was my favorite part. I learned how children with
Autism can benefit from programs that promote turn-taking, eye-contact, and
verbal and non-verbal communication. We choose "Connect Four" to help Emily
gain social skills and an activity she would enjoy. Connect Four was also
educational for Emily and helped strengthen her cognitive skills. Learning
more about Handwriting Without Tears was very fun and effective in helping
children improve legibility including ability to write their first name.
Daily picture schedules help develop the ability to transition from one
activity to another and it also improves behavior. I really enjoyed
picking activities that were appropriate for Emily. The hardest part of the
entire case study was coming up with appropriate objectives for the goals we
specified. I would like to do my first level II Fieldwork in a school, so I
enjoyed these interventions for our client, Emily. It was hard to pick an
activity that was individualized for Emily; we had so many ideas at first,
it was hard to narrow it down.
