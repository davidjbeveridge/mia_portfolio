summary: "A brief reflection on why I joined AOTA"
text: >
  I chose my AOTA membership for my occupation- based artifact. Being a
  member of AOTA is evidence based because it is a great way stay up-dated
  with new information within Occupational Therapy. Also, it allows me to be
  apart of a network where innovative research takes place, new ideas are
  formed within the profession and these ideas are shared between
  Occupational Therapists. This is important to join AOTA because it allows
  me to stay connected to the changes in the profession. It allows me to
  read occupational information, helps me stay interested in new ideas and
  stay connected if I need guidance in the field. AOTA is a pool of
  knowledge.
