  There werenâ€™t many articles that researched the effectiveness of the same
  adaptation. There were adaptations for a ping pong racquet and
  quadraplegics/ tetrapalegics that were effective. I learned that producing
  an adaptation and make sure to have enough time to produce this adaptation
  is important when trying to come up with an adaptation for a client. I had
  trouble trying to come up with adaptations for every aspect of the tennis
  game for a client who had Cerebral Palsy. I thought that was the hardest
  part. The glove was the easiest to come up with, but I learned that it is
  possible to find a solution to persevere. The easiest part was researching
  articles and finding supporting articles for the adaptation.
