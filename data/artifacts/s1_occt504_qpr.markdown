In my first semester I was very interested in learning about stroke. I picked
constrained induced movement therapy on upper extremity. I was fascinated by how
constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) works, and wondered if it was really
effective. I was skeptical before reading this article. The control group
improved most on the Performance Time and the Functional Ability scale. When
they compared the two groups (the treatment group and non-treatment group), the
researchers saw a dramatic improvement with individuals who were a part of the
CIMT group with regard to the quality and speed of movement in their paretic arm
after the treatment in the CIMT group. It was also interesting to see a
longitudinal study that gathered data by following up with the participants
after four, eight, and 12 months.

I had a difficult time with APA formatting for my reference page and making
sure the headings for each section were clear. I also struggled with the
in-depth statistical analysis. Overall, I had a great time learning about
this randomized clinical trial and this study taught me a lot about CIMT
while attending various classes. I gained more understanding of how
therapists typically implement a CIMT intervention and I was glad I chose
this topic.
