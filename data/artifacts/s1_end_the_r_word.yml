  I pledged to end the use of the r-word (“retarded”) as part of the "Spread
  the Word to End the Word" campaign. The Special Olympics helps with the
  ongoing intent to promote the inclusion and acceptance of people with
  intellectual disabilities. By refusing to use the r-word we are advocating
  for individuals who have intellectual disabilities by helping ensure they
  are being treated appropriately. Using the r-word excludes people from
  social groups and does not emphasize their strengths. It alienates certain
  people and I am helping to put a stop to this. This is important to me
  because I think individuals who have disabilities need to be encouraged
  through positive reinforcement, rather than torn down through the use of the
  r-word. It is important to me to not reinforce stereotypes of people who
  have intellectual disabilities. It is not acceptable to degrade or insult
  those who have intellectual disabilities, and it shouldn't be tolerated.
