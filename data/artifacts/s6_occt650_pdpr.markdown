title: "Semester 6&mdash;OCCT 650: Professional Development Plan & Reflection"
summary: >
  My personal mission statement, goals, and objectives for the next 10 years.
---

Creating a professional development plan was was very taxing, but rewarding in
the end. I am a dreamer; it was good to get all my dreams on paper and turn them
into goals by establishing concrete objectives and setting a timeline for each
to be met. I realized that through the many classes I’ve taken at Touro, I’ve
developed the academic and personal resources necessary to make my dreams come
to life. It is relieving to apply a date and measurable outcome to each of my
goals. I enjoyed this assignment and hope to stick to this timeline. I am very
goal-oriented and I'm driven to accomplish the things that I am passionate
about, such as helping abused children. I believe I can accomplish a lot in a
short period of time. Completing this professional development plan has taught
me about my strengths and weaknesses as a leader and how to capitalize on my
strengths. The most difficult part of this assignment was identifying goals for
the first three years and trying to be realistic. I know that I can be
ambitious, but I usually meet my goals if I am committed to them.
