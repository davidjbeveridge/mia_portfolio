  In April of 2013, I was elected Vice President of the Geriatric Interest
  Group. I attended several officer meetings to discuss what events we were
  going to attend this following year. In conclusion, we decided we were going
  to be apart of the voter registration campaign, Parkinsonâ€™s walk, salad
  fundraiser, American Geriatric Society Conference and volunteer at the
  Heritage Senior Center. It was interesting to try to plan out the year
  together with the new officers. I really enjoyed getting to know the other
  officers and strategically plan with the officers. We are so different, but
  it great to have the same vision and that is to try to serve seniors in the
  community as future health professionals.
