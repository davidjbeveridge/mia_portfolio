  A description of my development and growth in the discipline of
  occupation-based practice.

Making sure that intervention sessions and treatment plans are client-centered
is important. It is important to have occupation-based interventions because the
interventions are effective.  Occupation-based interventions provide clients
with a deep sense of meaning and control over their own journey to recovery. It
is also important to use occupation-based assessments to most accurately
determine the client's level of function.  I have experienced this firsthand
with my clients; during fieldwork my client had progressively become happier
when I provided occupation-based interventions and seemed more engaged.

I still need to improve my occupation-based interventions by using a more
collaborative approach with the parent and the child. During my first Level II
Fieldwork, I felt like that there weren’t many opportunities to have a
conservation with the parent, so I had to gain as much information as possible
at the IEP meeting to provide better occupation-based activities (i.e., play).
I incorporated play into almost every session and made that a priority, but I
would have liked to incorporate meaningful activities that the student was
interested in more often.  One time I incorporated Spiderman into the treatment
session because one of the students expressed an interest in Spiderman.  I
included a Spiderman dot-to-dot to work on tracking for a non-preferred
activity, but he didn’t enjoy the activity as much as I had hoped.  I was
disappointed, but I just have to realize that clients might not always like my
interventions and try to find something else they might enjoy the next time.
The key is to never give up and try something else, and to go out of the way to
communicate with the parents about what might interest the child.

I have had many opportunities to use occupation-based practice.  It is important
to use occupation-based interventions with each client in order to achieve
optimal results.  Occupation-based practice is the essence of what makes
occupational therapy unique; it is important that we put clients and their
desired occupations at the center of our practice.
