  Shade tree is an organization that provides shelter to women and
  families escaping abusive situations; I helped organize a Shade Tree donation
  drive for the cohort.

I organized a donation drive for Shade Tree in conjunction with my classmate,
Nikita Malhotra. Nikita and I sent an e-mail to the 2014 Occupational Therapy
cohort asking them to bring in some items to donate; we were to collect these
items and deliver them following week. I grew as a leader in my ability to deal
with logistical issues, which turned out to be more nuanced than we had
originally planned: Nikita and I had to be flexible and work with many of our
classmates to bring items on the a different day. I intentionally led by
example, being among the first to donate some toiletries. I communicated with
people who had schedule conflicts and made sure to accommodate their schedule by
extending the due date. I learned how essential communication is to being a
leader. Communicating with Nikita and the other students in the cohort was vital
in order to donate as many items as possible but still make a reasonable
delivery time.
