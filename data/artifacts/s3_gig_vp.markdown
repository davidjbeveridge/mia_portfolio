In April of 2013, I was elected Vice President of the Geriatric Interest
Group. I attended several officer meetings to discuss what events we were
going to attend this following year. We decided we were going
to be a part of the voter registration campaign, Parkinsonâ€™s walk, salad
fundraiser, American Geriatric Society Conference and volunteer at the
Heritage Senior Center. It was interesting to try to plan out the year
together with the other new officers.  I really enjoyed getting to know the other
officers and strategically plan with them. We are all different, but
it's great to share the same vision to serve seniors in the
community as future health professionals.
