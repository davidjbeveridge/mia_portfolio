I thought I did really well with synthesizing the information and putting
together everything I learned during the first semester. I thought the
hardest part was trying to going through the Occupational Therapy Practice
Framework (OTPF) and deciding what information was applicable to a
particular diagnosis. Going through the OTPF helps me to think about the
client’s strengths and weaknesses from a holistic perspective. This really
tested my knowledge of which areas are affected by which disease and which
areas are left intact. Another aspect I learned a lot about was different
types of strokes. Researching what type of stroke my hypothetical patient
would have and then deciding the appropriate interventions was interesting.
Before doing this activity I didn’t know what a transient ischemic attack
(TIAs) was, but I had fun learning. I felt like a did a really good job
making sure to talk about every safety risk and figuring out the potential
hazards.
